**Retail Price Analysis and Forecasting**

This repository contains the analysis and predictive modeling of retail pricing data aimed at forecasting market trends and optimizing revenue.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide insights into retail pricing strategies and predict market behavior. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze the retail price data to understand the influence of unit prices on revenue and identify potential price optimization opportunities.

Features

Correlation Analysis: Understand the relationship between different variables and the quantity sold.
Data Leakage Detection: Ensure the integrity of the model by checking for future data mistakenly included in the training set.
Predictive Modeling: Utilize historical data to forecast future trends.
Partial Dependence Plot: Visualize the effect of unit price on average predicted revenue.
